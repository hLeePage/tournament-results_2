
SWISS TOURNAMENT ORGANIZER PROJECT
--------------------------------------- 
This project uses a 'test case' python file to demonstrate the functionality of tournament.py-- an implementation of a simple Swiss-system tournament organizer.


REQUIREMENTS
-------------
This application requires Python 2.7 as well as PostgreSQL for its database component.


OPERATION
----------

--All three files (tournament.sql, tournament.py, tournament_test.py) should reside in the same folder.

--To set up the database and necessary tables, use "\i tournament.sql" from within the PSQL terminal.

--Finally, exit PSQL and run tournament_test.py from the terminal.
